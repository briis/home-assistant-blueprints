  description: >
    #### Automate Schneider Wiser 4-Button Battery Switch by Zigbee2Mqtt events.

    This Blueprint is specific for controlling a Media Player. 

    You must create an Input Selct Helper that contains a list of Radio Channels or other sources that the media player can access.

    The Buttons are paired as follows:

    * Upper Left button Short Press: Start Playing

    * Upper Right button Short Press: Pause Playing

    * Lower Left button Short Press: Go to next item in the Playlist

    * Lower Right button Short Press: Go to Previous item in the Playlist

    * Lower Left button Long Press: Turn up the Volume

    * Lower Right button Long Press: Turn down the Volume
