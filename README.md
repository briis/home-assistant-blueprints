The blueprint is specifically created to play Radio Stations, but can easily be adapted to other media.<br/>- Top Left Button/Single Press: Start Playing current or default media<br/>- Top Right Button/Single Press: Pause media<br/>- Lower Left Button/Single press: Move to next Radio Station in Input Select<br/>- Lower Left Button/Hold: Turn Volume up on Speaker<br/>- Lower Right Button/Single press: Move to previous Radio Station in Input Select<br/>- Lower Right Button/Hold: Turn Volume down on Speaker<br/>I use this for my speakers in the bathrooms, where I have a Input Select with defined radio stations, and whenever that changes value it triggers Music Assistant to play that station.
